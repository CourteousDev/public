# Want some help with homework or other STEM-related problems? Follow this `#how-to-ask` guide.

How to ask questions:

1. Pick the right channel. Use common sense to pick the most suitable topic channel for your problem. If you're unsure which channel to use, post in the channel you think is appropriate and people will direct you to the right channel if needed. Don't post your STEM questions to `#stem-general` unless you want to start a high level STEM discussion.

2. Describe your problem. Send a message describing the problem you need help with. Don't "ask to ask" - that is, make sure you actually describe your problem in your message. If your question is simply "Can someone help me?", it will be ignored. Here are some examples of good and bad questions:

```
# Bad examples
* Is anyone online?
* I need help with trig!
* Anyone here good with integrals?

# Good examples
* I'm trying to find all roots of 12x³ - 5x² + 12 = 0.
* [picture] I got this question on the problem set, the task was to find the value of angle A.
* I have a question about singular value decomposition. 
  You know how all of the singular values have to be non-negative, but [...]
```

> You can post a picture of your problem if you want, but make sure it has good lighting and correct orientation. If the image contains multiple problems, specify which problem you need help with. See https://sol.gfxile.net/dontask.html for more guidance.

3. State what you don't understand, and which approaches you have already tried We want to help you learn, so most of the time we will guide you through the problem instead of just giving you the solution. To do that effectively, we need to know your strengths and weaknesses in relevant subjects. This helps us skip the parts that you understand well and focus on things that you need to learn more about.

Consider these examples of good and bad explanations:

```
# Bad examples
* [no explanation]
* I just don't understand the question lol
* Can someone just give me the solution?

# Good examples
* I don't understand the question. Are they asking me to factorise y out of the equation?
* I tried to solve 12x³ - 5x² + 12 = 0 by factorising the x out and got x = -1.03 and x = 0.93 ± 1.03i. Can someone please check my answer?
* I don't get what "orthonormal basis" is supposed to mean. 
  I checked wikipedia and tried googling but none of the explanations make sense.
